# Introduction
LEL (Little Embedded Libraries) is a fully open-source project that allows anybody to connect to a router and access information. LEL was made to allow any person to find a little library, connect to a network, and learn about the surroundings of the little library.
LEL works with no internet and allows you to keep your network secure.

Want to try it? Go below and follow the steps to set it up!

## Before You Start
Before you start building, you need the correct software and hardware. All of the details will get you started on your journey.

### Hardware
LEL can run on any router. LEL runs an open-source router firmware called OpenWRT. 
Below is a button to see if your router is compatible. Please search for your router inside the link.

### Software
Before you start anything, you will need to download and install of of this software to your computer.

## Installing OpenWRT
To install OpenWRT on your router, [Click Here](https://openwrt.org/toh/views/toh_fwdownload?dataflt%5B0%5D=supported%20current%20rel_%3D23.05.3) and search for your router in the table. Then, click on the blue Factory Image link that is next to your routers name.
Make sure you click on the Factory Image download or else it will not work. Also, we highly recommend only downloading it if the Support version is higher than 19.0.0. If it isn't, this guide may not work and may brick your router.


Once on your computer, connect to your router via an ethernet cable for higher connectivity speeds. Wifi will also work for this. Then once connected, go to your router's admin panel in your browser which is mostly 192.168.1.1. If it doesn't work check your routers 
manual.
